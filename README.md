## Description
            
This project is a portfolio website built using the [React](https://react.dev/) Javascript library and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

I built this application as a way to showcase information about myself and my development skills alongside  a way for other users to contact me. 

By completing this project, I now understand the nuances of how to create a React application by creating separate components, pages and utilities to then join them together in an efficient manner.

### Screenshots of the deployed application:

- The website's 'About' page displayed on a larger desktop screen (1200px width or greater):

## Installation

To install this application, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. [Refer to this guide from GitHub if you need help.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository/)

Once cloned, you will need to navigate to the project's folder in your terminal then add the project's dependencies and run the application. 

You can do both by entering the following on one line: `npm i; npx vite`.

I also referenced the following tutorial from user 'FullStack Mastery' to help fix several bugs with the hamburger menu and incorporate it properly as a React component:
